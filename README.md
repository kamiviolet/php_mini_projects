# php_mini_projects
A collection of mini projects created with XAMPP for learning purposes.

## To run any of the projects locally
As the projects are built with XAMPP(Crossed-platform Apache MariaDB Perl Php), the easiest and most recommended way to do so is to install XAMPP in your computer.
The link to Apache Friends is as follows:
[https://www.apachefriends.org/]

Please follow the official documentation to download the package for your own platform and go through the installation.

## Mini-project 1 (on-going)
- A most simplistic webpage with form handling, allowing users to register and be redirected to the confirmation page.
- The input data will be sanitized and stored in the mySQL database.
- The password will be hashed for security reason.
